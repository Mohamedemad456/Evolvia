## 🔧 Configuration

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS v4 is configured via the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin. Custom colors are defined in `src/index.css` using the `@theme` directive.

### Vite
Vite configuration is in `vite.config.ts`. The React plugin and Tailwind plugin are already configured.

## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all components
- Follow React best practices

### Component Structure
- Keep components in appropriate folders
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Export components as default exports
